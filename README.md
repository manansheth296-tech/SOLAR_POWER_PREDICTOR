‚òÄÔ∏è SunSight AI: Solar Power PredictorProject OverviewSunSight AI is a full-stack web application that uses a machine learning model to predict solar power generation. The project demonstrates a complete, end-to-end workflow, from fetching real-world weather data to serving AI-powered predictions through a sleek, modern dashboard.The application is built for the Indian context, with the AI model trained on comprehensive weather and solar data for over 30 major Indian cities.üõ†Ô∏è Tech StackFrontendReact + TypeScript: A powerful library for building the user interface.Vite: A fast and lightweight build tool.Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.Recharts: A charting library for data visualization.BackendPython: The core language for data processing and the AI model.FastAPI: A modern, high-performance web framework for building the API.Uvicorn: An ASGI server to run the FastAPI application.Machine LearningScikit-learn: Used to train the RandomForestRegressor model.Joblib: For saving and loading the trained model.Pandas & NumPy: Essential libraries for data manipulation and numerical operations.üèÉ Getting StartedPrerequisitesNode.js & npm: Download from nodejs.org.Python 3.8+: Download from python.org.Git: To clone the repository.Installation & SetupClone the Repository:git clone [https://github.com/manansheth296-tech/SOLAR_POWER_PREDICTOR.git](https://github.com/manansheth296-tech/SOLAR_POWER_PREDICTOR.git)
cd SOLAR_POWER_PREDICTOR
Install Python Dependencies:pip install "fastapi[all]" uvicorn scikit-learn pandas numpy requests plotly
Install Frontend Dependencies:npm install
üöÄ Running the ApplicationFollow these steps to run the full-stack application.Step 1: Data Fetching and Model TrainingThis step prepares the data and trains the AI model. It only needs to be done once.python fetch.py
python training.py
Step 2: Start the Backend APIOpen your first terminal window and run the FastAPI server. This serves the AI model.uvicorn api:app --reload
The API will be running on http://127.0.0.1:8000.Step 3: Start the Frontend AppOpen a second terminal window and run the Vite development server. This launches the dashboard.npm run dev
The application will open automatically in your browser. The frontend will now communicate with the backend to get real-time predictions from your trained model.üìã Hackathon Problem StatementThe project aims to solve the challenge of accurately predicting solar power generation in a distributed grid environment. By leveraging real-time weather data and a trained machine learning model, the application provides homeowners and solar panel owners with valuable insights into their system's performance, helping them optimize energy usage and identify potential issues. The solution demonstrates the power of AI in creating actionable insights from complex environmental data.
